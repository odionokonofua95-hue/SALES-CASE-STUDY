# 📊 Sales Analysis Case Study – BrightLearn Data Analytics

A Complete Metrics & Insights Project Based on Daily Retail Trading Data

This repository contains a full analysis of the Sales Case Study dataset, as described in the project brief.
The objective is to build key metrics, analyse performance, calculate price elasticity during promotions, and extract meaningful insights using data-driven methods.

## 📘 1. Introduction

The dataset contains daily trading information for a large retail store, focused on one product only.
Each record contains:

* Date

* Sales (Total Rand value of the sales)

* Cost of Sales

* Quantity Sold 

* Case Study - Sales Analysis

This project explores the dataset, derives important metrics, and presents visual insights to support business decision-making.

## 🎯 2. Project Objective & Requirements

Based on the case study instructions, this project delivers the following metrics and analyses:

* Required Metrics

* Daily sales price per unit

* Average unit sales price

* Daily % gross profit

* Daily % gross profit per unit

* Promotion Period Analysis:

* Select any 3 promotional periods

* Calculate Price Elasticity of Demand (PED) for each

* Evaluate whether the product performs better or worse during promotions

Any additional insights, including:

Visualisations

Reports

Dashboards

Additional KPIs


Case Study - Sales Analysis


## 📐 3. Metrics Developed
3.1 Daily Sales Price per Unit

Calculated as:

Sales ÷ Quantity Sold

3.2 Average Unit Sales Price

The mean of daily unit price values across the dataset.

3.3 Daily % Gross Profit
Gross Profit = Sales – Cost of Sales  
Gross Profit % = (Gross Profit ÷ Sales) × 100

3.4 Daily % Gross Profit per Unit
Gross Profit per Unit = (Sales – Cost of Sales) ÷ Quantity Sold  
% GP per Unit = (Gross Profit per Unit ÷ Unit Price) × 100

## 🏷️ 4. Promotion Period & Price Elasticity Analysis

Three promotional periods were selected and analysed for:

* Price changes

* Quantity sold changes

* Price Elasticity of Demand (PED):

* PED = % Change in Quantity ÷ % Change in Price


Insights include:

* Whether demand is elastic or inelastic

* How promotions influence profitability

* Whether promotional pricing boosts or harms performance

## 📊 5. Analytical Insights & Visuals

The project includes additional insights such as:

* Seasonal or daily sales patterns

* Understanding peak and low-performing days.

* Price vs Quantity relationships

* Showing how customer behaviour shifts with price changes.

*Tracking gross profit over time.

### KPIs

* Average daily sales

* Unit price trends

* Gross profit margins

* Sales variance during promotional vs non-promotional periods

These insights expand on the case study's instruction to derive “any other interesting insight” from the dataset.
